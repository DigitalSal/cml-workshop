== Preface

=== Customer Churn Hands On Lab

==== Objective

In this exercise we will implement an end-to-end machine learning workflow using Cloudera Machine Learning, including: 

. Data ingest 
. Data exploration 
. Model training and experimentation
. Model serving 
. Business applications and 
. MLOps - model operations 

=== Business Use Case

In this Hands On Lab you will create a model to predict customer churn and present model-driven insights to your stakeholders. You will use an interpretability technique to make your otherwise “black box model” explainable in an interactive dashboard. A mathematical explanation is beyond the scope of this lab but if you are interested in learning more we recommend the https://ff06-2020.fastforwardlabs.com/[Fast Forward Labs Report on Model Interpretability]. Finally, you will use basic ML Ops techniques to productionize and monitor your model. 

=== Prerequisites for workshop participants:
- Need to have Workload password set (this will be needed for CDV part where CDW is queried)

=== Environment Setup for workshop:
- Need Impala CDW large enough to support 50 - 100 users hitting it during workshop
- Need table in the DL that contains churn dataset, available to query through CDW above (this is for DataViz)
- Single ML Workspace as the primary working environment 
- *Important!* Ensure that at ML Workspace creation both Model Metrics and Governance features are turned on (they are off by default). 
- Use this document for all preparation
// For 2nd day of workshops, need to recreate the ML Workspace

== Lab 1: Configure and deploy the Workshop Content as an https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/applied-ml-prototypes/topics/ml-amps-overview.html[AMP] (15 min)

AMPs (Applied Machine Learning Prototypes) are reference Machine Learning projects that have been built by Cloudera Fast Forward Labs to provide quickstart examples and tutorials. AMPs are deployed into the Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) experience, which is a platform you can also build your own Machine Learning use cases on.

- Go to the Workshop Environment (provided by instructor)
- Navigate to the Machine Learning tile from the CDP Menu 
- Click into the Workspace by clicking the Workspace name (provided by instructor)

A Workspace is a cluster that runs on a kubernetes service to provide teams of data scientists a platform to develop, test, train, and ultimately deploy machine learning models. It is designed to deploy a small number of infra resources and then autoscale compute resources as needed when end users implement more workloads and use cases.

- Click on *User Settings*
- Go to Environment Variables tab and set your *WORKLOAD_PASSWORD* (provided by instructor).

In a workspace, Projects view is the default and you’ll be presented with all public (within your organization) and your own projects, if any. In this lab we will be creating a project based on Applied ML Prototype. 

- Click on *AMPs* in the side panel and search for “workshop”

- Click on the AMP card and then on *Configure Project*

*IMPORTANT* +

* In the Configure Project screen, change the HIVE_TABLE to have a unique suffix. Leave the other environment variables as is. +
